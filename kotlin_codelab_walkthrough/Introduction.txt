1. Introduction
Who else likes to collect postage stamps? Why not learn a few Android concepts while creating a simple stamp collector app? When you have a large amount of data to display, you need a view that can handle the data efficiently. With the help of the RecyclerView class, you can display stamp-collection data very smoothly. To save information about all the stamps you've collected, you can use Android SharedPreferences.

Note: SharedPreferences are used here just for simplicity's purpose. For a real-time application, you want to use other storage options available in Android, such as the SQLite database, Room Database, or Google Cloud storage over the network.

What you'll build
In this codelab, you will build an app that displays a collection of stamps in a list format and saves data about the stamps. While creating the app, you'll learn how to:

Create your own custom RecyclerView object from scratch.
