7. Finishing up

Congratulations, you're all done!

Test the finished StampCollector app in an emulator and on an actual device, and you see the list of stamps displayed in a RecyclerView. This codelab only introduces you to the concept of using RecyclerView objects and shared preferences. You learned how you can add, update, and even delete a stamp.

You can also add more advanced features, such as letting users snap photos of stamps and add them to the list. You can include a RESTful web service to keep the list of stamps updated as new stamps come on the market.

There are lots of possibilities and ideas that you can incorporate and try. Now use this concept to design something cool of your own.
